# Neural-Physics-Engine-demo-package
Neurophysical core â€” private. This repository contains a public showcase: a brief description of capabilities, an example (raw) dataset, and a demo video of the neurophysical core in action.

# What the system does

1) The system learns cause-and-effect relationships between agents and objects in the environment on the fly. When a scene is launched, it:

2) Receives observation strings (the state of the scene at time t),

3) Forms predictions of local steps/reactions in regression, which takes place as a sequence of small transformations,

4) When interacting (contact), it learns to predict the consequences of interaction and adjusts its future steps,

5) In interactive mode, it accepts an external goal and adapts the agent's behaviour in real time.
